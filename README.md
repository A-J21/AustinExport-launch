# **Static Website Launch for a Local Business**

This is a test launch of a static website for a family-friend's local business. We decided to create this website due to Google's new rule about displaying business details and contact information online. According to this rule, businesses are required to have a website before allowing the information about their services and contact information to appear in Google search results.

## Accomplishment

My first major accomplishment is that is this my first static website that i was able to launch. Coming from this achievement I also leanred some valuable skills and knowledge to use in the future. I will list the skills here:
- Launching webiste
- Obtaining a Domain 
- Using the Domain to host my code
- Obtaining a SSL certification

## Future Ideas

I ultimately want to use a service called Azure static webiste. To reach this goal I will use a video made by 
James Montemagno about Static Web Apps, the video I will be using is
