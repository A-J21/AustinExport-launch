# **Static Website Launch for a Local Business**


This is a test launch of a static website for a family-friend's local business. We decided to create this website due to Google's new rule about displaying business details and contact information online. According to this rule, businesses are required to have a website that provides information about their services and contact information in order to appear in Google search results.
