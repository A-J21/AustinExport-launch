# **Static Website Launch for a Local Business**

This is a test launch of a static website for a family friend's local business. We decided to create this website due to Google's new rule about displaying business details and contact information online. According to this rule, businesses are required to have a website before allowing the information about their services and contact information to appear in Google search results.

## Accomplishment

My first major accomplishment is that this is my first static website that I was able to launch. Coming from this achievement, I also learned some valuable skills and knowledge to use in the future. I will list the skills here:
- Launching a website
- Obtaining a domain
- Using the domain to host my code
- Obtaining an SSL certificate

## Future Ideas

Ultimately, I want to use a service called Azure Static Web Apps. To reach this goal, I will use a video made by James Montemagno about Static Web Apps. The video I will be using is located at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgP4p8qhi4s.
